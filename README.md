## About the Video Course
Microsoft's Power BI is one of the most powerful business intelligence tools on the market. It provides actionable information about your company's data through appealing dashboards and visualizations. To present insightful visualizations, you need to perform statistical operations and data-crunching. That's how DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) boosts Power BI functionalities. Through its library of functions and operators, you can build formulas and expressions to simplify that task.
In this course, you will use Power BI with DAX to transform your company's data into a visualization to better understand and interpret your data. You will begin by understanding the limitations of your data, then clean it to make it available for the right dataset. You will be creating required workspaces on the web and learning new (and updating existing) development skills using DAX. Enhance your data models for normal and advanced calculations to create interactive reports using the large set of visualizations that are available.
Toward the end of the course, you will monitor your business data to get rapid answers via rich dashboards and visualizations available on every device.
